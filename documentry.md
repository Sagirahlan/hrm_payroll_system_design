### Architecture Patterns
1. **Model-View-Controller (MVC)**: Separation of business logic, presentation, and data
2. **Repository Pattern**: Abstract data access layer
3. **Service Layer**: Encapsulate complex business logic
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Handle system events and notifications
5. **Dependency Injection**: Manage class dependencies and reduce coupling

### Development Environment
- PHP 8.2+ (minimum requirement from composer.json)
- Composer for dependency management
- Node.js and NPM for frontend assets
- MySQL or compatible database system
- Web server (Apache, Nginx, or built-in PHP server)

## Payroll Calculation Process

### The Calculation Algorithm

The payroll calculation is managed by the `PayrollCalculationService` class, which implements a comprehensive algorithm to handle various scenarios including suspended employees, statutory requirements, and employee-specific adjustments.

#### Detailed Calculation Process

1. **Employee and Grade Level Retrieval**
   - Load the employee record with associated grade level information
   - Validate that the employee has a valid grade level assigned
   - Retrieve the current step information for salary calculation
   - Handle cases where grade level or steps are not defined

2. **Basic Salary Determination**
   - Get the basic salary from the employee's current step within their grade level
   - For active employees: basic salary = step basic salary
   - For suspended employees: basic salary = (step basic salary) / 2
   - Apply this halving logic consistently throughout calculations

3. **Statutory Deduction Calculations**
   - Retrieve all statutory deduction types associated with the employee's grade level
   - Calculate amounts as percentages of the adjusted basic salary (halved for suspended employees)
   - Apply the percentage from the grade level adjustment pivot table
   - Add calculated amounts to total deductions accumulator
   - Track these deductions for detailed reporting

4. **Statutory Addition Calculations**
   - Retrieve all statutory addition types associated with the employee's grade level
   - Calculate amounts as percentages of the adjusted basic salary (halved for suspended employees)
   - Apply the percentage from the grade level adjustment pivot table
   - Add calculated amounts to total additions accumulator
   - Track these additions for detailed reporting

5. **Employee-Specific Adjustment Processing**
   - Query all non-statutory deductions for the employee that are valid for the payroll month
   - Validity check: start_date <= payroll_month <= end_date (or end_date is null for ongoing)
   - Calculate deduction amounts based on their configuration (percentage or fixed)
   - Apply percentage-based deductions to the basic salary if linked
   - For suspended employees, apply halving logic to percentage-based deductions if appropriate
   - Add calculated amounts to total deductions accumulator

   - Query all non-statutory additions for the employee that are valid for the payroll month
   - Apply same validity checks as deductions
   - Calculate addition amounts based on their configuration
   - Add calculated amounts to total additions accumulator

6. **Net Salary Calculation**
   - Apply the formula: Net Salary = Basic Salary - Total Deductions + Total Additions
   - Ensure the calculation accounts for any special handling (like suspended employee adjustments)
   - Return comprehensive results including breakdown of all components

### Handling Suspended Employees

#### Special Processing Logic
When an employee is in "Suspended" status, the system applies special calculation rules:

1. **Basic Salary Adjustment**
   - The basic salary used in calculations is halved
   - This affects all percentage-based calculations that depend on basic salary

2. **Statutory Deduction Impact**
   - Percentage-based statutory deductions are calculated on the halved basic salary
   - Fixed statutory deductions are also halved to maintain proportionality
   - This ensures suspended employees pay reduced statutory obligations

3. **Statutory Addition Impact**
   - Percentage-based statutory additions are calculated on the halved basic salary
   - Fixed statutory additions may also be reduced proportionally

4. **Non-Statutory Adjustment Handling**
   - Percentage-based non-statutory deductions linked to basic salary are halved
   - Fixed non-statutory deductions remain unchanged (unless specifically configured otherwise)
   - Non-statutory additions follow similar logic based on their configuration

#### Implementation Details
The suspension logic is implemented in multiple places:
- Payroll generation process
- Payroll calculation service
- Payslip generation
- Bulk operations
- Individual adjustment calculations

### Workflow Process

The system implements a comprehensive workflow to ensure proper payroll approval:

1. **Generation Phase**: Payroll records are created with "Pending Review" status
2. **Initial Review**: Records are sent for initial review, changing status to "Under Review"
3. **Review Completion**: Records are marked as "Reviewed" after initial review
4. **Final Approval**: Records are sent for final approval, changing status to "Pending Final Approval"
5. **Final Approval**: Records are approved with "Approved" status
6. **Payment Phase**: Records can be marked as "Paid" after payment processing
7. **Rejection Path**: Records can be rejected at various stages with reason documentation

### Calculation Validation and Error Handling

1. **Data Validation**
   - Verify employee has valid grade level assignment
   - Ensure grade level has associated steps
   - Confirm step has valid basic salary amount

2. **Error Scenarios**
   - Handle missing grade level (set all values to 0)
   - Handle missing steps (set all values to 0)
   - Handle invalid basic salary (set to 0)

3. **Return Values**
   - Complete breakdown of all calculated components
   - Individual deduction and addition records
   - Total amounts for each category
   - Final net salary calculation

## Business Logic Details

### Complex Business Rules

#### Payroll Processing Rules

**Suspended Employee Processing**
- Basic salary calculation = (grade level step basic salary) / 2
- All percentage-based statutory deductions calculated on halved amount
- Fixed statutory deductions also halved for proportional fairness
- Non-statutory percentage-based deductions linked to basic salary halved
- Net salary calculated with all adjustments applied to halved base

**Statutory Compliance Rules**
- Statutory deductions automatically applied based on grade level
- Percentage rates determined by salary scale configurations
- Legal compliance for all statutory requirements
- Time-based application of statutory adjustments

**Payment Processing**
- Payment transactions created for each payroll record
- Bank information validation before payment
- Payment status tracking and reconciliation
- Automatic payment file generation for bank processing

#### Employee Status Management

**Active Status Rules**
- Full payroll processing
- All statutory and non-statutory adjustments applied
- Full access to benefits and allowances
- Standard deduction and addition processing

**Suspended Status Rules**
- Salary halved for calculation purposes
- Proportional adjustment of percentage-based items
- Continued employment relationship
- Maintained benefit eligibility (as per policy)

**Retired Status Rules**
- No ongoing payroll processing
- Final settlement calculations
- Pension transition management
- Access restriction to active employee features

#### Workflow Business Logic

**Multi-stage Approval Process**
- Initial generation creates records in "Pending Review" status
- Departmental review moves to "Under Review"
- Review completion moves to "Reviewed"
- Final approval moves to "Pending Final Approval"
- Administrative approval moves to "Approved"
- Payment processing moves to "Paid"

**Permission-based Workflow Access**
- Each stage requires appropriate permissions
- Overlapping permissions for different review levels
- Administrative override capabilities
- Audit trail at each workflow stage

### Calculation Algorithms

#### Complex Salary Calculations

**Net Salary Formula**
```
Net Salary = Basic Salary - Total Statutory Deductions - Total Non-Statutory Deductions + Total Statutory Additions + Total Non-Statutory Additions
```

**Step Progression Logic**
- Automatic step progression based on years of service
- Grade level promotion criteria
- Merit-based advancement tracking
- Automatic salary scale progression

**Retirement Eligibility**
- Based on maximum retirement age from salary scale
- Based on maximum years of service from salary scale
- Whichever comes first determines retirement date
- Automatic retirement processing at eligibility date

#### Tax and Compliance Calculations

**Statutory Requirement Processing**
- Pension contributions calculated on basic salary
- Tax calculations based on current tax brackets
- National Health Insurance contributions
- Social security contributions

**Regional Variations**
